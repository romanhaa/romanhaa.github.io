      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://satijalab.org/seurat/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Seurat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;scanpy&lt;/a&gt; are both great frameworks to analyze single-cell RNA-seq data, the main difference being the language they are designed for.&#xA;Most of the methods frequently used in the literature are available in both toolkits and the workflow is essentially the same.&#xA;However, Fabian Theis and his group (with special credit to Alex Wolf) have recently published their &lt;a href=&#34;https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1663-x&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;PAGA&lt;/a&gt; algorithm that attempts to harmonize dimensional reduction with clustering and trajectory analysis.&#xA;This is very exciting and a step in the right direction as tSNE and UMAP are known to have limitations in this regard.&#xA;However, if you are a heavy Seurat/R user, you will be bummed to hear that for now (at least to my knowledge) no R port of PAGA exists and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the authors have intentions to change this.&#xA;As far as I know, Cole Trapnell and his lab are working on implementing something similar, if not precisely the PAGA algorithm, in &lt;a href=&#34;http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/monocle3/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;Monocle 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
